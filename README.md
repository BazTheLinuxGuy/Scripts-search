# Scripts-search
The purpose of these programs, which so far center around one main program, "get_scripts_in_usr_bin.py" is to find the number of programs in the directories of executables (e.g. "bin" directories) that are scripts (Python, Perl, for example. Not to leave out the many sh-scripts and POSIX scripts that I have found,) rather than compiled programs. 

I am not biased toward these scripts. I am a C/C++/assembly programmer from the old days, and I like to compile/assemble my programs so that they run fast.

I have taken up Python within the past two years, (on and off), and have come to appreciate the "script" approach to programming. Prior to learning some Python, I programmed in Perl (version 5) for several years, and really liked it.

On average, between a quarter and a third of the programs in /usr/bin have turned out to be scripts. Some of these are short "helper" scripts to get the "real" (ELF, compiled) program loaded. But many are fully operational Python programs, such as the Fedora 30/31/32 program "firewall-config." And so on with Perl programs, and even Bourne-shell scripts. They can be instructional as well as just interesting to peruse.

I am still trying to learn the use of packages in Python3. If anyone has ANY experience using the Python3 modules based on improving command-line programs ("python3-cliff","python3-click","python3-clint" or others; PLEASE call me or write me at bazthelinuxguy@gmail.com with the subject line "I programmed with Cliff" (or clint, or click, whatever the package or module may have been. I would SERIOUSLY appreciate some help with these and would be ever thankful, though I don't have enough money to pay you (much).
